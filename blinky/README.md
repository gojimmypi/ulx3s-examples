# ULX3S Examples

## FPGA Blinky

Note when programming the ULX3S in Windows, Lattice Diamond does not recognized the FT232 as a programmer, so `fujprog` is needed to send the bitfile. 

When using WSL, `fujprog` compiled as linux app will not work due to [lack of USB suppport](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2185#issuecomment-306083436). Instead, use the windows `fujprog.exe`  (callable from WSL). 

If not, `fujprog` will return a message about not being able to find the JTAG cable. 

```

Cannot find JTAG cable.
