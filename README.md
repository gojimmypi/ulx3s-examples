# ULX3S Examples

Getting started with the [ULX3S](https://radiona.org/ulx3s/) is easy! You just need a Verilog source code file and the [constraint file](./doc/constraints/ulx3s_v20.lpf). 

To program the FPGA on the ULX3S, either the commercial [Lattice Diamond](http://www.latticesemi.com/latticediamond) or Open Source tools such as [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys), [nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) and  [ujprog](https://github.com/f32c/tools/tree/master/ujprog) are needed.

If you've never worked with FPGA devices, they are programmed with a _hardware definition_ language or "HDL", that may look like a traditional programming language - however it is quite different. The "code" is really just a clever shorthand for how circuits and logic gates are connected. Verilog is one type of HDL. 

You can learn more at sites such as [fpga4fun](http://www.fpga4fun.com/), [asic-world digital logic](http://www.asic-world.com/digital/tutorial.html), [asic-world verilog](http://www.asic-world.com/verilog/veritut.html) and [nandland](https://www.nandland.com/verilog/tutorials/index.html).

Once you have your circuit logic generically defined properly in a Verilog file, the hardware-specific constraint file is used to connect the inputs and outputs of the Verilog code to physical pins on the FPGA device.

## Common Problems

Here are some common problems that may be encountered, and how to resolve them.

### FT_Open() failed Cannot find JTAG cable.
Check to see if the serial port is in use, such as:
* Arduino Serial Monitor
* Visual Micro Serial Monitor
* Putty
* Anything else that might have the serial port in use

### Found unknown (FFFFFFFF) device, but the bitstream is for LFE5U-12E.

This error has been seen when experimenting with SPI pins to get VSPI/HSPI working. Create and upload a blank Arduino project (empty `setup` / `loop`)
