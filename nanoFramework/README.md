# Programming the ULX3S ESP32 using C# in Visual Studio

In order to program the ESP32 on the ULX3S, the [PassThru FPGA](../passthru/README.md) code needs to first be loaded.

Programming in C# will require the [nanoFramework Extension for Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nanoframework.nanoFramework-VS2019-Extension)
or the [nanoFramework Extension for Visual Studio 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-1470366.nanoFrameworkVS2017Extension); yes, they are different!

Next, if you want to compile the [nanoFramework](https://nanoframework.net/) itself, the Arduino IDE ensure that the Espressif SDK 1.0.1 or later is installed. For more details, see the [ESP32 Blinky for ULX3S](../../blinky/ESP32/README.md)

# Quickstart C# on the ULX3S ESP32

In order to propgram C# on the ESP32, a special bootloader is needed.

See the [upload_firmware.bat](./upload_firmware.bat); this uploads the binaries in [./bin/](./bin/) to the ESP32.

If these binaries do not work, check the versions. The latest binaries can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter#firmware-for-reference-boards).
Note the files are not hosted on GitHub. Don't despair if there are no downloads available, click on the "Files" for a download. Might be nice to have the GitHub links go directly there.

# Installing the nanoFramework.

The first thing to consider is if the nanoFramwork supports the ESP32 on the ULX3S. 
The documentation explicitly calls out the ESP32 DevKit-C. 
The ULX3S uses the ESP WROOM-32. 
The [Espressif docs indicates the DevKitC also uses the WROOM-32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc/overview):

The easiest way to install the nanoFramework extension is from the Visual Studio `Extensions - Manage Extensions`:

# Find ULX3S in Device Explorer

Key to uploading C#-compiled code, is ensuring Visual Studio can "see" the devices. Ensure the ULX3S is plugged into a USB port.
Click on `View - Other Windows - Device Explorer`. If the device is not listed, you may need to exist Visual Studio and try again.
There does not appear to be a "device refresh / rescan" feature. When found, it should look something like this:
 
![device explorer](./images/device_explorer.png)

# Create a Project

There does not seem to be an easy way to browse to the project type:

![visual_studio_no_project](./images/visual_studio_no_project.png)

So you may need to search for it:

![visual_studio_search_project](./images/visual_studio_search_project.png)

# Troubleshooting

if you see an error like "Couldn't find a valid native assembly required by mscorlib v1.3.0.3":

![failure_mscorlib_missing](./images/failure_mscorlib_missing.png)

Ensure the Core Library checkbox is checked:

# Building the nanoFramework bootloader.
